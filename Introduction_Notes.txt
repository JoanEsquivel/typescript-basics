Dynamic vs Static Typing

Dynamically typed languages, the types are associated with the run time
values and not named explicitly in your code. 

Statically typed languages, you explicitly assign types to variables, functions,
parameters, return values, etc.

Static -> Java, C, Go
Dynamic -> Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP

Pros
-> More Robust
-> Easily Spot Bugs
-> Predictability
-> Readibility
-> Popular

Cons
-> More code to write
-> More to learn
-> Required Compilation
-> Not True Static Typing
